# Fund and spend an example "pay to multisig" SimplicityHL contract
# on Liquid Testnet.

# Dependencies: simc hal-simplicity jq curl

# This demo has been updated to not require the use of elements-cli.
# Some tasks could be simpler or more scalable in some sense if we used
# a local elements-cli, but here we use the Liquid Testnet web API
# instead to remove local dependencies. The main reason for this is that
# elementsd will require multiple gigabytes of blockchain data. Having
# a working local copy of elementsd can be useful for other development
# tasks, but represents a larger time and disk space commitment.

# We assume the SimplicityHL repository was cloned under the current
# working directory. If you cloned it elsewhere, please update these
# paths to reflect the appropriate location.

# This is an unspendable public key address derived from BIP 0341. It is
# semi-hardcoded in some Simplicity tools. You can change it in order
# to make existing contract source code have a different address on the
# blockchain but you must use a NUMS method to make sure that the key
# is unspendable. BIP 0341 gives a method to modify the number below to
# retain that property.
#
# If you are sending assets to a contract created by someone else, you
# must make sure that the internal key used for that instance of the
# contract is an unspendable value (if it is changed from this default).
# Otherwise, the contract creator may be able to unilaterally steal
# value from the contract.
